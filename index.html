    <h1>Director's Note: November 2021</h1>
    <p>A lot has changed in the past one year ,and well it looks like the COVID-19 Pandemic is here for some good time. To my OVERCOMERS, congratulations! Now, technology has become a reality for Africans and our understanding of the world has expanded exponentially. We exist in  a place where the mundane is far beyond even what our parents could have envisioned. However, the same skills, curiosity and drive that made our parents unique in their time,now serve as the engines of innovation throughout the global eceonomy. Kemigisha is a scientist, realtor,engineer, artist, inventor, dreamer,problem solver and above all, a <strong>BORN-AGAIN</strong> christian.She not only imagined a world where humans escaped the shackles that bound them to the narrow-mindedness of the Middle Ages but also conjured and built protypes of the machines that would serve as the jailer's keys.</p><br>
    <p>In the last decade, the term <emp>STEM</emp> an acronym for the disciplines of science, technology, engineering, and math has become synonymous with the skills and industries that generate a steady stream of innovations in :</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Computing</li>
            <li>Medicine</li>
            <li>Transportation and many others</li>
        </ol>s <br>
    <p>A modern day " Renaissance man" looks like Kemigisha. The most obvious way is that these 'men' are women and men, girls and boys of all ethnicities, socioeconomic backgrounds, upbringings and demographics. Throughout the four Keisha Omnibus towers and stores, be it in our exhibition halls or education programs, we offer opportunities and inspiration for Renaissance people of any age and from any neighborhood to imagine themselves as the next Kemigisha and the creator of their future world.</p>
